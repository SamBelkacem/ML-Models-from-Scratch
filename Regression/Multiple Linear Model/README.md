# Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) Model from Scratch

In this repository, I share my Python implementations of a multiple linear regression, also called multivariable linear regression, model from scratch. 

## Table of contents:
- Problem setup
- Data example
- MLR with analytical solution
- MLR with gradient descent
- MLR with scikit-learn

## Demos
