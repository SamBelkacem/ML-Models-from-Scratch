# Simple Linear Regression (SLR) Model from Scratch

In this repository, I share my Python implementations of a simple linear regression model from scratch. Here are the table of contents:

- Problem setup
- Data example
- SLR with analytical solution
- SLR with gradient descent
- SLR with scikit-learn
